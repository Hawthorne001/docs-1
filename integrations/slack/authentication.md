[Install the Baselime integration for Slack](https://slack.baselime.io/slack/install).

Once you install the app in your Slack workspace, you can start interacting with Baselime app as a Personal app or access from channels. By default, the Baselime app is enabled in all the public channels. For private channels, you need to explicitly invite /invite @baselime

At this point, your Slack and Baselime user accounts are not linked. You will be prompted to log in Baselime. This is a primary step required to access the app.
