# Welcome to the Baselime Documentation

[Baselime](https://baselime.io) is an observability as code platform for serverless architectures. It helps developers collect, analyze, and understand the telemetry data generated by their serverless applications. With Baselime, you can:

- Ingest logs, metrics, traces, and other telemetry data from your serverless applications
- Use multiple interfaces to interact with your data, including a web console, a CLI, and a Visual Studio Code extension
- Integrate with tools you already use, such as GitHub, Slack, Jenkins, and PagerDuty

## What is Observability as Code?

Observability as code is the practice of treating the monitoring and debugging of an application as part of the application's codebase. This means that the configuration of monitoring and debugging tools is stored in version control and treated like any other code.

With observability as code, you can:

- Maintain a clear, up-to-date record of how your application is being monitored and debugged
- Collaborate with your team on monitoring and observability configuration
- Automate the configuration of monitoring and observability tools

Baselime is built on the OpenTelemetry observability framework, which provides a standard way to instrument applications for observability. With Baselime, you can easily implement Observability as Code in your serverless applications.

## What is Telemetry Data?

Telemetry data is information about the performance and behavior of an application. It includes:

- Logs: Recorded messages that provide information about the application's execution
- Metrics: Quantitative measurements of the application's performance, such as CPU usage or request latency
- Traces: Detailed records of the steps taken by the application as it processes a request
- All other data your application emits during at runtime, such as CloudTrail logs, internal event for EDAs, etc.

Collecting and analyzing telemetry data is essential for understanding the health and performance of an application. With Baselime, you can easily ingest and analyze telemetry data from your serverless applications.
