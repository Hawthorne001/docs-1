# Templates

Templates are a powerful way to share patterns and best practices when it comes to observing your Serverless app. A template is a collection of `.yml` files that contain [queries](../analysing-data/queries.md), [alerts](../analysing-data/alerts.md). Templates can be shared publicly or within organisations to help teams consistently manage their O11y, and prevent us from all having to write the same lambda timeout alert for every project!

## Getting started

You can find the templates in the UI when creating new services, or through the [baselime cli](../cli/install.md).

To list the available templates run 

```bash
baselime templates list
```
