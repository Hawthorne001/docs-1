# OpenTelemetry over HTTPS

---

If your codebase is already instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), you can start sending your tracing data to Baselime today.

Add the Baselime OpenTelemetry endpoint to your exporter:
- Endpoint `https://otel.baselime.io/v1/`
- Header: `x-api-key: <BASELIME_API_KEY>` 

Get your public Baselime API key in the [Baselime console](https://console.baselime.io).
