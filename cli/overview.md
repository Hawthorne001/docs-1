# Baselime CLI Documentation

This is the documentation for the Baselime CLI. It is relevant to anyone working with Baselime's CLI-based workflows; this includes developers who use Baselime CLI by itself, as well as those who use Baselime CLI alongside other Baselime products.

Notably, thid documentation does not cover the specifications of the `.baselime` folder. For that, see the [Observability as Code Documentation](../observability-as-code/overview.md).
