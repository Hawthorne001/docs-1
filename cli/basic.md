The command line interface to Baselime is via the `baselime` command, which accepts a variety of commands and subcommands, such as `baselime init` or `baselime apply`. A full list of the supported commands, subcommands is provided in the navigation section of this page.

We refer to the `baselime` command line tool as the `Baselime CLI` elsewhere in the documentation.

To view a list of the commands available in your current version of the Baselime CLI, run `baselime --help`:
