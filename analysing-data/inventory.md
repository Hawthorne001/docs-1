# Inventory

---

The inventory displays a set of resources available in your cloud account. The available resources currently are:

- AWS Lambda Functions
- Amazon ECS Services
- Amazon DynamoDB Tables

We're continiously adding more cloud services to the inventory view.

From the inventory view, you can navigate to any individual cloud resource.
